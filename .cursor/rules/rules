You are working on a 3-week MVP called LinkOps AI.

PROJECT CONTEXT
- This is a frontend-first MVP built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui.
- The current focus is UI/UX correctness and feature parity with the PRD.
- Backend, database, and authentication are NOT implemented yet.
- All data is currently mocked or stored in client-side state.
- Do NOT introduce backend logic, Supabase code, or authentication unless explicitly requested.

PRODUCT GOAL
- Capture client opportunities from pasted text.
- Use AI (mocked for now) to extract:
  - summary
  - required skills (MULTIPLE skills supported)
  - urgency (high / medium / low)
- Allow manual assignment of opportunities to team members.
- Track opportunity status using a Kanban-style workflow.

STRICT SCOPE RULES
- Stay within the MVP scope defined in the PRD.
- Do NOT add new features unless explicitly requested.
- Do NOT refactor unrelated files.
- Do NOT introduce new pages or routes unless asked.
- Do NOT remove existing functionality unless instructed.

UI / UX RULES
- The dashboard and opportunities page must reflect all active filters visually.
- Any filter applied must be:
  - clearly visible on screen
  - removable individually
  - removable via a "Clear / View All" option
- Users must never filter by data that is not visible on the card or table.
- Skills must be displayed as individual tags, never as a single concatenated string.
- Skill selection must support MULTIPLE skills.
- Skill lists must be scrollable when long.
- Layout must be compact and avoid wasted vertical space.
- Consistent color palette and spacing across all screens.
- Sidebar collapse state must persist across navigation.

COMPONENT BEHAVIOR RULES
- "Add Opportunity" button must work on both Dashboard and Opportunities page.
- Reuse the same modal component for creating opportunities.
- Editing an opportunity must persist changes in UI state.
- AI processing must show a clear loading overlay or modal.
- AI results must be editable before final creation.

FILTERING RULES (CRITICAL)
- Filters must never result in an empty UI with no recovery path.
- Always provide a way to reset filters and view all data.
- Status filter must exist on the Opportunities page.
- Skill filters must match individual skills, not grouped strings.
- Member filters must show the assigned member visually on cards.

DATA MODEL (FRONTEND ONLY)
- Opportunity:
  - id
  - clientName
  - companyName (optional)
  - originalText
  - summary
  - skills: string[]
  - urgency
  - status (New | Assigned | Done)
  - assignedMemberId (optional)
  - createdAt
- TeamMember:
  - id
  - name
  - skills: string[]
  - activeCount
  - completedCount

AI RULES
- AI logic is mocked or simulated.
- No real API calls unless explicitly requested.
- AI output must always return structured data:
  - summary
  - skills[]
  - urgency

CODE QUALITY
- Prefer small, readable components.
- Avoid over-engineering.
- Favor clarity over cleverness.
- Leave TODO comments when something is intentionally incomplete.

COMMUNICATION STYLE
- Before making large changes, explain intent briefly.
- If requirements are unclear, ask for clarification instead of guessing.
